final String normal = "MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys";

final String pname = "p.His4_Gln5insGla";

What is p name?
Given an amino acid sequence p name describes a mutation
Expanding the format p.Xyzn_AbcminsDef
p. => constant prefix indicating its a pname
Xyzn => amino acid at position n, where n is a number
Abcm => amino acid at position m, where m is a number
ins => constant meaning insert (there are other constants but lets focus on insertion)
Def => amino acid(s) to insert

q. method that takes normal and mutated and derives pname
